Graphs:

# Graphs are a collection of nodes connected by edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected.

# Basic components:
# - Node (Vertex): A point in the graph.
# - Edge: A connection between two nodes.

# Types of Graphs:
# - Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have a direction.
# - Undirected Graph: Edges do not have a direction.


# - Weighted Graph: Edges have weights.
# - Cyclic Graph: Contains cycles (a path that starts and ends at the same node).
# - Acyclic Graph: Does not contain cycles.

# Graph Representation:

# - Adjacency Matrix: A 2D matrix to represent connections between nodes.
# - Adjacency List: A collection of lists to represent connections, where each list represents
#           the connections of a single node.
